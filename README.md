### Hi there, I'm Souhardya (@amisouhardya) 👋

- 👀 I’m interested in:
  - **Quantum Field Theory**, **High-Performance Computing**, and **Scientific Simulation**
  - Building tools at the intersection of physics and computer science
  - Exploring efficient numerical algorithms for large-scale physical systems

- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - **Rust** for systems-level development and safe concurrency
  - **Machine Learning** applications in physics, especially using PyTorch
  - Advanced topics in **Quantum Electrodynamics** and **Non-Abelian Gauge Theories**

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
  - Open-source projects focused on **physics engines**, **symbolic computation**, or **scientific visualization**
  - Developing a **custom simulation framework** for field theory problems
  - Building educational tools for undergraduate physics learners

- 📫 How to reach me:
  - Email: physics.souhardya@gmail.com  
  - LinkedIn: [linkedin.com/in/amisouhardya](https://linkedin.com/in/amisouhardya)  
  - GitHub Discussions or Issues are also welcome!

- 😄 Pronouns: **he/him**

- ⚡ Fun fact:
  - I once created a **custom LaTeX engine** to typeset tensor equations dynamically.
  - I believe in the fusion of **code, clarity, and curiosity**—bridging theoretical physics with practical tools.
